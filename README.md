# CRUD React APP

This simple app illustrates CRUD operations in pure react code.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Suggestions of what to contribute

1. Editing should highlight the current post being edited and disable all edit buttons. Finally, submit post should change to update post and the posts should maintain their ordering.
2. LocalStorage or IndexedDB should be added
3. The app should be converted to a PWA
4. The app should be deployed to netlify. I'm struggling to deploy it there
5. React router can be added to handle opening of posts. Posts should open on a new page with a route
6. Posts which are too long should be trucated on the home page
